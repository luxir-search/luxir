# Plugins

Luxir extends through compiled-in plugins. There is no dynamic loading, no shared
objects and no C ABI: a plugin is a CMake target that the engine executables link,
and it registers its components through a generated translation unit.

## Model

- `luxir_lib` never depends on plugins. Plugins depend on `luxir_lib` and use its
  headers directly.
- The `luxir` executable links the library `luxir_plugins`, which holds the
  generated `addConfiguredPlugins()` plus every non-test-only plugin library.
  `luxir_test` links `luxir_test_plugins`, which adds the test-only plugins.
- Registries (`luxir::Registries::global()`) are process-global. They are filled once
  by `luxir::initPlugins()` and then frozen: later registration throws, and lookups
  read immutable tables without locking.
- Registering a name that already exists throws `std::invalid_argument` during
  startup, so a misconfigured binary fails loudly instead of overriding silently.

## Startup order

`initPlugins(addPlugins)` runs after configuration is applied and before any `LuxirNode` or
`Schema` exists (`luxir_main` and the test `main` both call it). It is idempotent.

1. Built-in components are registered (`registerBuiltinAnalysis`, so built-in names are
   taken before any plugin can claim them).
2. The `addPlugins` callback (executables pass `addConfiguredPlugins`, so the reference
   comes from the executable and the generated object is linked in) adds every
   configured plugin, in link-list order.
3. Each plugin's `registerComponents(Registries&)` runs. A throw aborts startup.
4. The list is logged at info level (`plugins: name version, ...`).
5. The registries are frozen.

## Writing a plugin

A plugin directory holds a `CMakeLists.txt` and sources:

```cmake
luxir_add_plugin(NAME my_plugin
                 SOURCES MyPlugin.cpp
                 [LIBRARIES some::target]
                 [INCLUDE_DIRS include]
                 [TEST_SOURCES MyPluginTest.cpp]   # gtest files compiled into luxir_test
                 [TEST_ONLY])                      # link into luxir_test only
```

```cpp
#include "luxir/plugin/Registries.h"

class MyPlugin : public luxir::Plugin {
public:
  luxir::PluginInfo info() const override { return {"my_plugin", "1.0", "what it does"}; }
  void registerComponents(luxir::Registries& r) override { /* register into r */ }
};

LUXIR_PLUGIN(my_plugin, MyPlugin)
```

The `NAME` must match `[a-z0-9_]+` and the first argument of `LUXIR_PLUGIN`. The
macro defines `luxir_plugin_create_<name>()` in the global namespace, which the
generated translation unit calls.

## Building with plugins

Point `LUXIR_PLUGIN_DIRS` at one or more plugin directories (semicolon separated):

```bash
cmake --preset gcc-debug -DLUXIR_PLUGIN_DIRS="/path/to/a;/path/to/b"
cmake --build --preset gcc-debug
```

Each directory is added with `add_subdirectory`, under `build/<preset>/plugins/<basename>`.
The configure step prints the configured plugin names, and the server logs them at
startup. The generated sources live in `build/<preset>/generated/`.

Plugin targets see the include directories `luxir_lib` keeps private (generated
protos, hash maps) and link TBB, so a plugin can build on engine internals such as
search ops, readers and `QueryPrep`.

## Node lifecycle

`Plugin::nodeStarted(LuxirNode&)` runs at the end of a node's construction, after
its collections are open; `nodeStopping(LuxirNode&)` runs first in its destructor,
in reverse plugin order. A process can run several nodes (tests do), so a plugin
that keeps per-node state keys it by node. A throw from `nodeStarted` aborts the
node's construction; `nodeStopping` is `noexcept`.

## Query types

`Registries::query` (`src/luxir/query/QueryRegistry.h`) adds query types next to the
built-in `Query` arms. On the wire a plugin query is the `plugin` arm,
`{name, params}` with `params` a map of typed JSON values. The JSON dialect also
reads a registered name as the arm key, so these are the same request:

```json
{"plugin": {"name": "doc_ids", "params": {"values": ["a", "b"]}}}
{"doc_ids": {"values": ["a", "b"]}}
```

An unregistered key stays an `unknown_key` JSON error; an unregistered `plugin`
name is a request error listing the registered types. Writes are canonical (the
`plugin` object), so `?explain=request` echoes that form.

```cpp
r.query.add("doc_ids", luxir::PluginQueryDef{
    [](luxir::PluginQueryContext& ctx) -> luxir::Query* {
      auto values = ctx.params.getStringList("values");
      const luxir::api::Val* within = ctx.params.get("within");
      ctx.params.rejectUnknown();
      // ... build an engine Query in ctx.parse.pool; nested queries go
      // through ctx.parseQuery(*within) ...
    },
    {{"values", luxir::PluginQueryArg::Kind::STRING_LIST},
     {"within", luxir::PluginQueryArg::Kind::QUERY}},
    "values"});
```

- The maker returns an engine `Query` allocated in `ctx.parse.pool` (queries are
  trivially destructible). It may return a built-in query (lower to `any_of`,
  boolean, ...) or its own `Query` subclass constructed with `QueryKind::PLUGIN`,
  which every planner shape question answers conservatively. All plugin query
  classes share that kind, so `equalsSameKind` must `dynamic_cast` the other
  query. A subclass that depends on documents across segments returns a
  reader-wide filter key scope (`READER_STABLE`).
- `ctx.parse.fields.note(text)` adds a line to `?explain=resolved`, for
  example what the query resolved its parameters to.
- `ctx.parse` is the request's `ParseContext`: pool, schema, the searched reader
  (`ctx.parse.reader`, null outside a search), coercion context, warnings and field
  resolver, which is everything `QueryBuilder` needs.
- `ctx.parseQuery(...)` lowers a nested `api::Query`, or a Query-shaped param (an
  object or an expression string), through the ordinary parser with the shared
  nesting budget.
- `ctx.params` (`PluginParams`) reads typed params and `rejectUnknown()` refuses the
  rest; every error names the type and the parameter.
- The expression arguments make the type callable in the expression language,
  `doc_ids([a, b], within=cat_s:x)`. Each argument parses by its kind (`STRING`,
  `NUMBER`, `BOOL`, `STRING_LIST`, `QUERY`); a `QUERY` argument is a sub-expression
  and reaches the maker as Query JSON. The positional argument, when named, takes
  the one positional value. Without expression arguments the type is JSON only.
- Names are `[a-z0-9_]+` and may not be a built-in arm name.

## Search ops

`Registries::searchOps` (`src/luxir/search/SearchOpRegistry.h`) adds operations next
to `top_docs`, `fusion` and the facets. On the wire a plugin op is the `plugin` arm,
`{name, params, ops}`; the dialect reads `{"<name>": {...}}` with the object's
`ops` member as the nested ops and every other member as a param.

The maker receives a `PluginOpContext` while the request is parsed and returns a
`SearchOp` subclass allocated with `luxir::arenaCreate` in `ctx.req.arena`:

- `parseQuery(...)` lowers and validates a query against the op's `planning()`
  context; `weightContext()` is the `Query::Context` for `createWeight`, and
  `planning().getFilterUse(query)` its filter cache entry.
- `parseSource(name, val)` parses a TopDocs-shaped param as a source the op runs
  itself, as `FusionOp` runs its sources: set its `rankingSink` and `parent`,
  create its calculator under the op's own, dispatch it per segment and receive
  the merged collector.
- `addSubs(op)` parses the nested ops into `op.subOps`. They run over whatever
  domain the op hands their calculators (`calcAll` with one `DomainHandle` per
  segment; an empty set, never null, for a segment with no documents), and may not
  declare their own `domain`.

The op's calculator follows the `SearchOp::Calculator` contract (see
`src/luxir/search/ops/SearchOp.h` and `FusionOp.h`). Results are a `Val` in the
response: `emitDocsResponse` (`EmitDocs.h`) writes a `DocList` with returned
fields, and its `extraColumns` add computed per-document values beside them
(`ExtraColumn{name, value(i, out, mr)}`). Extra columns are always returned; a
`fields` selection may name them, and one made only of extra columns (such as
`["_rank"]`) returns just those, while an empty selection projects the default
field set. A free-form result is a `Map`. Nested op
results go in the `DocList`'s `ops` (route them in `getTargetForSub`). `format=docs`
accepts only `top_docs` and `fusion` ops.

## HTTP routes

`Registries::http` (`src/luxir/server/HttpRouteRegistry.h`) adds routes to the HTTP
server. A pattern lives under `/_plugins/<plugin>/...` (node level) or
`/collections/{collection}/<_endpoint>/...` (collection level); `{name}` segments
capture. Built-in routes always win, so collection patterns may not end in a
built-in endpoint name or use `_snapshot`. Patterns may not overlap: two patterns
with the same segment count must differ at some position where both are literals
(`add` throws otherwise). Plugin routes are not reachable under `/tenants/{t}/`;
they always act in the default tenant, which is what `HttpPluginRequest::tenant`
holds.

```cpp
r.http.add("POST", "/collections/{collection}/_sample",
           [](luxir::HttpPluginRequest& request, luxir::HttpPluginResponse& response) {
  response.searchCollection = *request.pathParam("collection");
  response.searchBody = R"({"ops":{"sample":{"sample_docs":)" + std::string(request.body) + "}}}";
});
```

- The handler runs on a task-arena worker, so it may block on engine work through
  `request.node`. It answers with `status`, `contentType` and `body`, or sets
  `searchBody` to have the server run that body as a search with default URL
  options and answer as `_search` would (streaming, errors). The request's URL
  parameters are not applied to that search; they reach the handler as
  `queryParams`, so a route that wants `count_limit` or the like folds it into
  the body itself.
- A thrown `ApiError` answers with its classification; other exceptions are 500.
- A path with routes but not for the request's method answers 405 with `Allow`.
  Routes added with `mutating = true` are refused on a read-only node.

## The example plugin

`test/plugins/example` is a test-only plugin (always configured, linked into
`luxir_test` only). It registers a `doc_ids` query type, a `sample_docs` search op
(an extra `_rank` column and nested ops over its documents), two HTTP routes and
lifecycle counters, exercised end to end by `PluginExtensionTest`; `PluginTest`
covers the framework.

## Analysis components

`Registries::analysis` (`src/luxir/analysis/AnalysisRegistry.h`) maps names to makers
for four kinds of component. A maker receives the authored `api::AnalyzerComponent` (its
`name` and typed `params`), validates the params, and returns an immutable factory that
creates one stage per chain. Makers throw `std::invalid_argument` with a message that
teaches (what was wrong, what is valid); the registry adds "unknown filter 'x'; valid
filters: ..." for unknown names.

| Registration | Maker returns | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| `addTokenizer(name, maker)` | `TokenizerFactory` | splits the value into tokens |
| `addFilter(name, maker)` | `TokenFilterFactory` | wraps the previous stage (`TokenFilter`); `prepare` may analyze params through the preceding stages |
| `addCharFilter(name, maker)` | `CharFilterFactory` | rewrites the value before tokenization (`CharFilter`) |
| `addAnalyzer(name, def)` | (a complete `api::AnalyzerDef`) | a named analyzer |

Rules:

- Names are `[a-z0-9_]+`, unique per kind. A duplicate, or any add after the freeze,
  throws. Built-ins cannot be replaced.
- Put expensive shared state (a word set, a dictionary) in the factory, which is shared by
  every field using the definition; stages are per chain and not thread-safe.
- Follow the token borrow contract in `Analyzer.h`: a filter never writes the bytes it was
  given, it copies into its own buffer and repoints `token.text`. Set `normalizing = true`
  and override `normalizeTerm` only if the transformation is safe to apply to a multiterm
  (prefix, fuzzy) literal; stemmers are not. Set `stateful = true` if the stage buffers
  across tokens and needs `reset()` per value.
- A char filter (`src/luxir/analysis/CharFilter.h`) overrides `filter()`, reading `input`
  and calling `replace(start, end, text)` for each rewrite in increasing input order;
  unchanged input is borrowed and the base class records the edits, so
  `TokenChain::sourceOffset` maps token offsets back to the original text. A
  `normalizing` char filter also runs on multiterm literals.
- `addAnalyzer` deep-copies the definition into registry-owned storage, so the
  `AnalyzerDef` and its arena views may die right after the call. A definition may not
  itself be a named analyzer. Its components are checked when the registries freeze, so
  they may be registered after the analyzer; one that does not resolve fails startup.
  `Analyzer::compile` stores the expanded definition, never the name, in the canonical
  JSON that segment metadata persists. The stored schema keeps the name and expands it
  again at every load, so changing a registered analyzer takes effect for a collection
  when it next loads, for queries and new documents alike.
- The fused `unicode_word` + `nfkc_cf` fast path applies only to exactly those built-in
  components; plugin stages always run as written.
- A collection whose persisted schema names a component this binary does not have fails to
  load with the "unknown ..." message; the node keeps serving its other collections.

The example plugin registers a `reverse` filter (reverses token bytes, `normalizing`), a
`strip_x` char filter (removes every `x` through `replace`) and the analyzer `example` =
`whitespace` + char filter `strip_x` + filters `lowercase`, `reverse`:

```cpp
void registerComponents(luxir::Registries& r) override {
  r.analysis.addFilter("reverse", [](const luxir::api::AnalyzerComponent& def) {
    struct Factory : luxir::TokenFilterFactory {
      std::unique_ptr<luxir::TokenStream> create(std::unique_ptr<luxir::TokenStream> source) const override {
        return std::make_unique<ReverseFilter>(std::move(source));
      }
    };
    auto factory = std::make_unique<Factory>();
    factory->name = "reverse";
    factory->normalizing = true;
    return std::unique_ptr<luxir::TokenFilterFactory>(std::move(factory));
  });
  // addCharFilter("strip_x", ...) is the same shape with a CharFilterFactory.

  luxir::api::AnalyzerComponent whitespace, stripX, lowercase, reverse;
  whitespace.name = "whitespace";
  // ... set the other names ...
  luxir::api::AnalyzerDef example;
  example.tokenizer = whitespace;
  const luxir::api::AnalyzerComponent charFilters[] = {stripX};
  const luxir::api::AnalyzerComponent filters[] = {lowercase, reverse};
  example.char_filters = charFilters;
  example.filters = filters;
  r.analysis.addAnalyzer("example", example);
}
```

A schema then uses the plugin by name (`"analyzer": "example"`) or composes its components
(`"analyzer": {"tokenizer": "whitespace", "filters": ["reverse"]}`).
Text is fed to a chain with `TokenChain::setValue`, never `head.setValue`, so char filters
always run.

## Storage backends and layers

`Registries::storage` (`src/luxir/store/StorageRegistry.h`) holds named storage
backends and layers. `ram` and `fs` are built in and registered before plugins.

- A **backend** builds the root `DirectoryFactory` from the node configuration. It
  is selected by `--store.backend NAME`.
- A **layer** wraps the factory built so far. Layers are selected by
  `--store.layer NAME` (repeatable, innermost first) and sit between the backend and
  the core wrappers: `checked_dir` and `read_only` stay outermost, so a mutation is
  refused before any layer sees it.

Both makers receive a `StorageContext`: the whole `LuxirConfig`, the free-form
`options` map (`--store.option KEY=VALUE`, read directly or through `option()`,
`optionOr()` and `optionBytes()`), and `reclaim`, the callback RAM backends call
under memory pressure. Unknown names fail when the node opens its storage, with a
message listing the registered names.

```cpp
void registerComponents(luxir::Registries& r) override {
  r.storage.addBackend("s3", [](const luxir::StorageContext& ctx) {
    return std::make_unique<S3DirFactory>(ctx.option("bucket").value_or(""));
  });
  r.storage.addLayer("cache", [](std::unique_ptr<luxir::DirectoryFactory> inner, const luxir::StorageContext& ctx) {
    return std::make_unique<CacheLayer>(std::move(inner), ctx.optionBytes("cache_bytes", 1ULL << 30));
  });
}
```

A backend implements `DirectoryFactory`. Beyond the collection primitives it provides
`nodeDirectory()` (a stable directory for node-level files such as `replication.json`),
may override `holdsNoCollections()` (a follower refuses a data directory that holds
anything else) and `describe()` (one line for the startup log).

A layer derives from `DelegatingDirFactory` and overrides what it changes, usually
`container()` and `incarnation()` to hand out `DelegatingDirectory` subclasses. Both
bases forward every virtual, including `createFile` with options, `expectSynced`,
`deletePrefix`, `sync`, `underlying`, `linkFile`, `openChecksum` and `capabilities`.
A wrapper that changes the semantics of a mutator must override it explicitly.

### Capabilities

`Directory::capabilities()` reports what a backend can do: `HARD_LINK` (`linkFile`
shares bytes), `ATOMIC_RENAME`, `DURABLE_SYNC` (`sync` is an fsync), `MEMORY_MAPPED`
(`openFile` returns stable mapped bytes) and `REMOTE`. The default is none, which
selects conservative paths: `reuseFiles` copies with `Directory::copyFile` instead of
linking when `HARD_LINK` is absent. A wrapper that changes a property (for instance
masks `HARD_LINK`) overrides `capabilities()`.

### The example plugin

`test/plugins/example` registers a `counting_ram` backend (RAM storage counting
directory opens and creates per collection) and a `counting` layer (counting file
opens and creates). `StorageExampleTest` runs a node on both and asserts the counters
(`CountingStorage::count`).
