// A different way to get top-k results: Collect results in an array until we have 2k of them.
// The find the median (kth value), and drop all values less than the median. Repeat collection more results.
// This has the advantage of not having the bad worst-case behavior of a priority queue and collecting something
// that is already mostly sorted.  It is also more linear and doesn't degrade as much as k increases.
// The obvious downside is double the memory usage... we would want a different strategy if someone wants the
// whole index sorted for example.
// Also, since minCompetitiveVal is only updated every k docs, this is perhaps more compatible with
// multi-threaded collection (i.e. check/update a global minCompetitiveVal at the same time you calculate the
// new minCometitiveVal from the median.)  It also may just be less important to update this minCompetitiveVal
// in any case.
//
// I don't know who created this algorithm, but I learned about it from a blog post by Paul Masurel:
// https://quickwit.io/blog/top-k-complexity
//
// Performance: see the benchmarks in CollectorBM.cpp
//   For random order, this was slower across the board.  I think perhaps because there are more swaps.
//   For more complex sorts, we're going to need indirection anyway, so that may change things.
//   The tricky part of implementing indirection for this would be reusing the slots after you have
//   dropped half of them.  Seems worse for cache locality.
//   Update: I tried indirection (see TopScoreCollectorI) and it did improve performance.
